# Modern-Approaches-to-Data-Analysis-Project
This repository contains all the files and reports used during the final course project for modern approaches to data analysis. For this project the idea was to create a full report on the datasets given which are cereal.csv and Netflix.csv. We wished to do some predictive modeling as well as inference using any technique used throughout the semester.

1.) The first files to look at are our data files which are cereal.csv and Netflix.csv.

2.) The second file is the pdf report for the cereal data. The coding was done in R and the report was written in R markdown

3.) The third primary file is the pdf report for the Netflix data. This was much more challenging since the dataset is larger than       cereal.csv and there was plenty of data missing.
